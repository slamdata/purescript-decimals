### `purescript-decimals`

This is a library for doing exact computation with decimal numbers of finite
expansion (i.e. numbers that can be represented in the form `m * 10^n`).

See the [Documentation](./docs/Data/Decimal.md). The laws of each numerical
type class ascribed by `Decimal` are checked using StrongCheck.
